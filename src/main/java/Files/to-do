final project requirements

-use git (week 2)
-use maven structure (notum nú þegar, kannski bæta við pom skra eða ehv, 4)
-JUnit (not user interface, but like getters and setters etc. 5)
-UML design (8, 10)
-Design patterns, (e.g. the library system could introduce the concept of an omnibus, i.e.
                  a book divided into multiple volumes collected together in a box; a GUI typically uses
                  the observer patterns to observe the business objects), even patterns not covered in the
                  course) (9)
-refactoring (6)
-Package a jar file and provide a command so that an end user without an IDE or Maven
 can run your program (verk 3,4)
-Documentation (have the UML design part of it, but also mention where a pattern is
               used, what Maven goals are supported, the license, and have end user documentation,
               e.g., on how to run your jar) (10)

to-do for project
make user interface so we can run test cases
