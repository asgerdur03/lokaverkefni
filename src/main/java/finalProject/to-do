To-do laga:
gera design patterns
jar file? + jar file command


• Package a jar file and provide a command so that an end user without an IDE or Maven
can run your program (Chapter 3/Assignment 3 & 4): for running, you either need to
add for each dependency a separate jar file or let Maven create a fat jar that contains
all dependencies using the maven-assembly-plugin (do some web search as this was
not covered in this course).
